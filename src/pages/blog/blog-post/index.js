                        Now that the event is mere weeks away, it dawned on me that I've never actually done a bridal show booth before, or any booth for that matter. Yikes. Just as I was getting ready to hit the panic button, the ultra-talented Sarah Campbell from Intrigue Design invited me to her Annapolis studio to borrow props from her collection. Thank you, Jesus.<br />

                        When a creative-at-heart person such as myself invests fifteen years in the corporate world and then finally takes a leap of faith to start over where they really belong, getting the chance to tour an award-winning design studio is like heaven on earth. Not to mention, the opportunity to brainstorm with an expert like Sarah. Priceless. <br />
                        <br />
                        I arrived in the morning and Sarah and her team were busy at work on their last big wedding of the year! White blooms for days. Just breathtaking.

                <p className="second-txt"> We included a custom branded double sided notecard with Coca-Cola's logo in white text. We love how the notecard coordinated perfectly with the Coca-Cola red ribbon and gift tag. <br />
